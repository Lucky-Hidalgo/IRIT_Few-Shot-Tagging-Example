# Few Shot Tagging Example

This demo is an example of few shot classification using the OpenAI API to label dialogues between a LLM-tutor called SIMBA and students of a physics course. This was prepared specifically for a Demo for the TALENT (Teaching And Learning ENhanced by Technologies) team of Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of few shot learning techniques to classify and label dialogues in an educational context. The LLM-tutor, SIMBA, interacts with students, and the dialogues are labeled to identify different types of interactions and responses.

## Features

- **Few Shot Learning**: Utilizes OpenAI's models to perform classification with minimal training data.
- **Dialogue Labeling**: Labels interactions between SIMBA and students to categorize different types of dialogue.
- **Educational Context**: Focuses on dialogues from a Physics course to provide relevant examples.
